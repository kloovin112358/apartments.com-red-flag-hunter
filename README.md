This is a browser extension built out of frustration while searching for apartments online. You get excited after looking at the photos and seeing the price, but after a few minutes, you realize it's a basement apartment. This extension analyzes the page content of Apartments.com listings, and checks for 9 potential issues:

1. Listing has rent specials/discounts
2. Does not list monthly rent
3. Does not list square footage
4. Does not list unit number(s)
5. Is 1st floor or basement apartment
6. Photos of a similar unit
7. Square footage is abnormally low
8. [Chicago only] Busy street with heavy street noise
9. Last updated over a week ago

Built on Bootstrap.
